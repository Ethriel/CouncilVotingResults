 **ATTENTION**: my program needs specific files to work. You can download them for test here: [Files for test](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R8FlCRivMDpIe2snKSoY_KWSJ7dXqrLM)
My little program was made for self-use... It helps me to create as an output a HTML-table and XLSX-file for further use in my city's council website. 
## There are four blocks: 
## 1. Create HTML-table and XLSX-file. 
- Here you need to **select folder**, where local HTML-files are to parse info from them;
- Enter **criteria** by which these files will be selected by program;
- **Select path** to a folder, where XLSX-file will be;
- Enter **session name** - this is the name of our city's council session of deputies. This is a name of XLSX-worksheet;
- Enter **Title Name** - this s title of future HTML-table;
- **Select path** where local HTML-files are to parse info from them;
## 2. Add text to files names files
- Select **local path**, where files need to be renamed;
- Enter a **criteria** which will be added to EVERY file's name in selected folder;
- Enter **file extension** to select
## 3. Bulk rename files
- **Files extension**: extensions of files you want to rename.
- **Replace word**: files will be renamed like this: **this word**+**number**. ***number*** will be generated automatically.
- Once you done setting params press **corresponding button** and then **rename**.
- You can open folder to see results by pressing **see results** button.

## 4. Replace symbol in files names

- Simple as it is: enter **symbol** you want to replace, then with **what**, set **params** and **start**.
