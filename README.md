ATTENTION: my program needs specific files to work. You can down load them for test here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R8FlCRivMDpIe2snKSoY_KWSJ7dXqrLM
My little program was made for self-use... 
It helps me to create as an output a HTML-table and XLSX-file for futher use in my city's council website. 
There are two blocks: 
1. Create HTML-table and XLSX-file. 
Here you need to select folder, where local HTML-files are to parse info from them;
Enter criteria by which theese files will be selected by program;
Select path to a folder, where XLSX-file will be;
Enter session name - this is the name of our city's council session of deputies. This is a name of XLSX-worksheet;
Enter Title Name - this s title of future HTML-table;
Select path where local HTML-files are to parse info from them;
2. Reaname files
Select local path, where files need to be renamed;
Enter a criteria which will be added to EVERY file's name in selected folder;
Enter file extension to select
Once you done with all needed fields to be filled a corresponding buttons will appear. Press them :)
