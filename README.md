**ATTENTION**: my program needs specific files to work. You can download them for test here:  [Files for test](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R8FlCRivMDpIe2snKSoY_KWSJ7dXqrLM)  My little program was made for self-use... It helps me to create as an output a HTML-table and XLSX-file for further use in my city's council website.

## There are four blocks:

## 1. Create HTML-table and XLSX-file.

-   Here you need to  **select folder**. *Path to local HTML files to work*, *Path where XLSX file will be*, *Path where JSON file will be*
-   Enter  **criteria**  by which these files will be selected by program;
- A JSON file can be created **only** after tables were created

## 2. Add text to files names files

-   Select  **local path**, where files need to be renamed;
-   Enter a  **criteria**  which will be added to EVERY file's name in selected folder;
-   Enter  **file extension**  to select

## 3. Bulk rename files

-   **Files extension**: extensions of files you want to rename.
-   **Replace word**: files will be renamed like this:  **this word**+**number**.  _**number**_  will be generated automatically.
-   Once you done setting params press  **corresponding button**  and then  **rename**.
-   You can open folder to see results by pressing  **see results**  button.

## 4. Replace symbol in files names

-   Simple as it is: enter  **symbol**  you want to replace, then with  **what**, set  **params**  and  **start**.
